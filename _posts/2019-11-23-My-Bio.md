Hi! My name is Nathan Sanford and I'm a data scientist and applied mathematician. I received my PhD in applied mathematics from Northwestern University. I'm originally from Seattle, where I also went to college at Seattle University. While there, I participated in nonlinear water waves research under Professor John Carter, which gave me a passion for studying mathematical problems with real-world impacts.   

Upon entering graduate school at Northwestern, I continued to research nonlinear waves, but now in the context of nonlinear optics with Professor Bill Kath. Interestingly enough, the two fields share much of the same [mathematical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_Schrödinger_equation#The_nonlinear_Schrödinger_equation_in_fiber_optics), which originally led me into this field. <!--and beautiful [mathematical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrable_system). --> However, as my work progressed I became more interested in computations than theory, and in stochastic simulation in particular. This, in turn, led me to an interest in using computational methods to deal with noisy data in other settings. I hope that I can broaden my skillset and continue this work as a data scientist.

When I'm not trying to debug code, I enjoy playing soccer and hanging out with my cat Moo, who is camera-shy.
