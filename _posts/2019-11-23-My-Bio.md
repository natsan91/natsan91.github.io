Hi! My name is Nathan Sanford and I'm a data scientist and applied mathematician. I'm currently a PhD candidate in applied math at Northwestern University. I'm originally from Seattle, where I also went to college at Seattle University. While there, I participated in nonlinear water waves research under Professor John Carter.  

Upon entering graduate school at Northwestern, I continued to research nonlinear waves, but now in the context of nonlinear optics. Interestingly enough, the two fields share a number of the same [governing equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_Schrödinger_equation#The_nonlinear_Schrödinger_equation_in_fiber_optics) and beautiful [mathematical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrable_system).

When I'm not trying to debug code, I enjoy playing soccer and hanging out with my cat Moo.
